# Business_AI_Meeting_Companion-STT

Consider you're attending a business meeting where all conversations are being captured by an advanced AI application. This application not only transcribes the discussions with high accuracy but also provides a concise summary of the meeting, emphasizing the key points and decisions made.

sudo apt update

sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
